# ConnectedComponents

Takes an text image composed of "+" signs and generates sets for each cluster of connected components in the image. 
The output of running ConnectedComponents.java is the original image followed by the image with each component replaced with a different letter, 
a list of each letter in the image and the size of the component and finally the image with the smallest components (groups of less than 4) removed.
